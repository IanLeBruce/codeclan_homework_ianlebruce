books <- read.csv("books.csv") # load in the data and assign to "books"

glimpse(books) #11,123 rows and 13 columns

names(books) # get a feel for the data, note - not sure why it's not showing the first 3 names of rowid, bookid and title - closing and opening RSTudio solved this issue?

# task - sort the rows in order of rating with the best at the top

class(average_rating) # numeric as expected - note that data is a dbl which is part of the numeric set

books %>% 
  select(average_rating, title) %>%
  arrange(desc(average_rating))
  

# do head and tail to see at a glance the top and bottom values

# task - make a histogram and a boxplot of average_ratings

books %>% 
  hist(average_rating)



# task - make a barplot showing which languages are most frequent in the dataset

# first get that info in a table:

books %>% 
 select(language_code) %>% 
  count(language_code) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) 

# eng = 8908, en-US = 1408, spa = 218, en-GB = 214, fre = 144 etc

books %>% 
  barplot(c(language_code))


# task - add en-US and en-GB to the eng data
